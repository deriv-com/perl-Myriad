=head1 NAME

Myriad::Storage::Implementation::Redis - access to microservice storage via Redis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides an implementation of L<Myriad::Role::Storage> using L<https://redis.io>
as the underlying storage mechanism and transport layer.

See L<Myriad::Role::Storage> for API details.

=cut

use constant STORAGE_PREFIX => 'storage';

# L<Myriad::Transport::Redis> instance to manage the connections.
has $redis;

BUILD (%args) {
    $redis = delete $args{redis} // die 'need a Transport instance';
}

=head2 apply_prefix

=cut

}

=head2 get

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<< $k >> - the relative key in storage

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the corresponding value, or C<undef> if none.

}

=head2 set

Takes the following parameters:

or object will fail.
