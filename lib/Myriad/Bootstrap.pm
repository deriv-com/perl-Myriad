=head1 NAME

Myriad::Bootstrap - d√¶mon functionality and hot-reload for Myriad

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Controller process for managing an application.

Provides a minimal parent process which starts up a child process for
running the real application code. A pipe is maintained between parent
and child for exchanging status information, with a secondary UNIX domain
socket for filedescriptor handover.

The parent process loads only two additional modules - strict and warnings
- with the rest of the app-specific modules being loaded in the child. This
is enforced: any other modules found in C<< %INC >> will cause the process to
exit immediately.

Signals:

=over 4

=item * C<HUP> - Request to recycle all child processes

=item * C<TERM> - Shut down all child processes gracefully

=item * C<KILL> - Immediate shutdown for all child processes

=back

The purpose of this class is to support development usage: it provides a
minimal base set of code that can load up the real modules in separate
forks, and tear them down again when dependencies or local files change.

We avoid even the standard CPAN modules because one of the changes we're
watching for is C<< cpanfile >> content changing, if there's a new module
or updated version we want to be very sure that it's properly loaded.

One thing we explicitly B<don't> try to do is handle Perl version or executable
changing from underneath us - so this is very much a fork-and-call approach,
rather than fork-and-exec.

=head1 METHODS - Class

=head2 allow_modules

Add modules to the whitelist.

Takes a list of module names in the same format as C<< %INC >> keys.

Don't ever use this.

=cut

sub allow_modules {
    my $class = shift;
    @ALLOWED_MODULES{@_} = (1) x @_;
}


=head2 open_pipe

use socketpair to establish communication between parent/child later.

=cut

sub open_pipe {
    # Establish comms channel for child process
    socketpair my $child_pipe, my $parent_pipe, $constant{AF_UNIX}, $constant{SOCK_STREAM}, $constant{PF_UNSPEC}
        or die $!;

    { # Unbuffered writes
        my $old = select($child_pipe);
        $| = 1; select($parent_pipe);
        $| = 1; select($old);
    }

    make_pipe_nonblocking($parent_pipe);
    make_pipe_nonblocking($child_pipe);

    return ($parent_pipe, $child_pipe);
}


=head2 make_pipe_noneblocking

Takes a pipe and makes it nonblocking by applying C<O_NONBLOCK>

=cut

sub make_pipe_nonblocking {
    my $pipe = shift;
    my $flags = fcntl($pipe, $constant{F_GETFL}, 0)
        or die "Can't get flags for the socket: $!\n";

    $flags = fcntl($pipe, $constant{F_SETFL}, $flags | $constant{O_NONBLOCK})
        or die "Can't set flags for the socket: $!\n";
}

sub check_messages_in_pipe {
    my ($pipe, $on_read) = @_;
    # See https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/select#select-RBITS,WBITS,EBITS,TIMEOUT
    # for a better understanding
    my $input = '';
    my $rin = my $win = '';
    vec($rin, fileno($pipe), 1) = 1;
    my $ein = $rin | $win;

    die $! unless (my $nfound = select my $rout = $rin, my $wout = $win, my $eout = $ein, 0.5) > -1;

    if($nfound) {
        my $rslt = sysread $pipe, my $buf, 4096;
        return 0 unless $rslt;
        $input .= $buf;
        while($input =~ s/^[\x0D\x0A]*(.*)(?:\x0D\x0A)+//) {
            $on_read->($1);
        }
    }

    return 1;
}

=head2 boot

Given a target coderef or classname, prepares the fork and communication
pipe, then starts the code.
