=head1 NAME

Myriad::Role::Storage - microservice storage abstraction

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $storage = $myriad->storage;
 await $storage->get('some_key');
 await $storage->hash_add('some_key', 'hash_key', 13);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides an abstraction over the Redis-based data model used by L<Myriad> services.

For more information on the API design, please see the official
L<Redis commands list|https://redis.io/commands>. This model was
used as the basis for the methods even when non-Redis backend
storage systems are used.

=head1 Implementation

Note that this is defined as a r√¥le, so it does not provide
a concrete implementation - instead, see classes such as:
